%\section{Descriprion}
In this chapter we present results we have obtained using the methods described in previous chapter. For each rotational symmetry we have selected a Pisot-cyclotomic number and analyzed both one dimensional and two dimensional quasicrystals. 

For each Pisot-cyclotomic number we first show the number itself, several of its properties, then results of analysis of one dimensional quasicrystal and lastly results of analysis of two dimensional quasicrystal. 

Results for one dimensional quasicrystal entail table listing the set of distance between consecutive points of the quasicrystal for a window of certain size and two diagrams listing all possible Voronoi tiles and their periods.
